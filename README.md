## 🌍 Who Am I?

I'm an **aspiring software engineer** who began my self-learning journey in **January 2025**. I kicked off with the core web trio:  
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **JavaScript**, with **React** as my framework of choice.

Through curiosity and hustle, I stumbled upon **_WeThinkCode_**, applied with full commitment — and guess what? **I got accepted!** 🎉  
I'm now on an intense journey through the **Pre-Academic Year Programme**, sharpening my technical and problem-solving skills daily.

- 🧠 Developed a preference for using **Git Bash** for commits & pushes.
- 💡 Integrated **Git Bash into VS Code**, streamlining my workflow to commit changes directly from the IDE.
